The analysis done in PyCitySchools_starter.ipynb seeks to find insights about PyCitySchool District, a district that contains 15 schools varying in size, type, and budget. The analysis starts by summarizing the district as a whole (Total Schools, Total Students, Total Budget, Average Scores, and Average Percent of Students passing Math, Reading, and Both). It then provides a similar summary, but for each school individually. After this overview, the script dives into a series of interesting comparisons including:
•	Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)
•	Bottom Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing)
•	Math Scores by Grade
•	Reading Scores by Grade
•	Scores by School Spending
•	Scores by School Size
•	Scores by School Type
